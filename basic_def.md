### Statement
A **statement** is a grammatically correct sentence that conveys precise information.

### Equality of statements
Two statements are said to be **equal** if they both convey the exact same information.

### Negation of a statement
A **negation** of statement P is a statement conveying the exact opposite information of P. Since all statements conveying the same information are equal, we can refer to it as **the** negation of P. It is noted non P or non(P).
