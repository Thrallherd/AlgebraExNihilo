### Statement
A **statement** is a grammatically correct sentence that conveys precise information.

### Equality of statements
Two statements are said to be **equal** if they both convey the exact same information.

### Negation of a statement
A **negation** of statement _P_ is a statement conveying the exact opposite information of _P_. Since all statements conveying the same information are equal, we can refer to it as **the** negation of _P_. It is noted non _P_ or non(_P_).
