### Statements
A **statement** is a grammatically correct sentence that conveys information.

### Equality of statements
Two statements are said to be **equal** if they both convey the exact same information.

### Negation of a statement
A **negation** of statement _P_ is a statement conveying the exact opposite information of _P_. Since all statements conveying the same information are equal, we can refer to it as **the** negation of _P_. It is noted non _P_ or non(_P_).

### True and false statements
A statement is said to be **true** if the information it conveys is consistent with reality. A statement is said to be **false** if its negation is true.

### Disjunction of two statements
The **logical disjunction** of two statements _P_ and _Q_ is the statement that is true only if _P_ and/or _Q_ is true. It is noted _P_&#8744;_Q_.

### Conjunction of two statements
The **logical conjunction** of two statements _P_ and _Q_ is the statement that is true only if _P_ and _Q_ is true. It is noted _P_&#8743;_Q_.
