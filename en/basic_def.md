### Statements
A **statement** is a grammatically correct sentence that conveys information.

### Equality of statements
Two statements are said to be **equal** if they both convey the exact same information.

### Negation of a statement
A **negation** of statement _P_ is a statement conveying the exact opposite information of _P_. Since all statements conveying the same information are equal, we can refer to it as **the** negation of _P_. It is noted non _P_ or non(_P_).

### True and false statements
A statement is said to be **true** if the information it conveys is consistent with reality. A statement is said to be **false** if its negation is true.

### Disjunction of two statements
The **disjunction** of two statements _P_ and _Q_ is the statement that is true only if _P_ and/or _Q_ is true. It is noted $$P \lor Q$$.

### Conjunction of two statements
The **conjunction** of two statements _P_ and _Q_ is the statement that is true only if _P_ and _Q_ are true. It is noted $$P \land Q$$. It could also be defined as the negation of the disjunction of non _P_ and non _Q_, that is $$\text{non}(\neg P \lor \neg Q)$$.

### Implication between two statements
Given two statements _P_ and _Q_, the **implication** $$Q \lor \neg P$$ is noted $$P \implies Q$$. It is the statement that is true only if it is not possible for _P_ to be true without $Q$ being true as well.
